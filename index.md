# Shamex's second year notes
### I'm starting my second year of engineering, and i've decided to take notes in a different way -through this little page. 
### I have two main reasons for this: first, I want to improve my English writing skills (and there’s no better way than writing publicly); second, I want to organize my notes in a way that helps me really master the subjects I’m studying.
### With that said, below you’ll find the different subjects I’m focusing on, along with their topics and lectures. I hope you enjoy, and feel free to help me along the way <3.
